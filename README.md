# SciCraftSeedFinder

This was "forked" from L64's YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97OdqeiUfHw&t=1s).

I say "forked" because this was provided in a media download link &mdash; not from a repository.

## Changelog

### v1.0.0

- Added to version control
- Converted to a _gradle_ project
- Split project up into 3 projects: 
    - SciCraftSeedFinder (root)
